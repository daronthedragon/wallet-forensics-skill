/**
 * Batched token pricing.
 *
 * CoinGecko's unkeyed tier rejects any request carrying more than one contract
 * address, so pricing a wallet's holdings costs one throttled request per
 * token. An address that has been airdropped spam for years holds thousands of
 * them, which is hours of wall clock for a number nobody waits around for.
 *
 * DefiLlama's coins API takes many addresses per request and needs no key, so
 * the same work becomes tens of requests instead of thousands. It also returns
 * the symbol and decimals, which saves a separate metadata lookup.
 *
 * No imports: `fetch` is a global in the versions of Node this targets, which
 * keeps this file usable in a repo that must stay dependency-free.
